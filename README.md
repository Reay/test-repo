# test-repo

This repo is for an example in one of the coursera Data-Science Toolbox lecture video in week 2

Hi :) my name is wagish, I am a 3rd year physics student in NTU
I know very little about programming, and I am going to learn programming through online courses.

Main goal is to become more comfortable with online courses so that I can continue my career in physics as well as data science.

Wish me luck :)
